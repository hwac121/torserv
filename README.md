Tor Serv

Tor Serv is just a simple little bash script I made to make working with the tor service quick and easy. There is 
nothing special to it, just easier than trying to remember yet another set of commands in my senior years.

Feel free to alter, edit, or use this script or parts of it as you please if it makes your life easier.
